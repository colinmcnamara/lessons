=== While loops
Keeps executing a block of code, as long as a boolean express is True

They test and _if-statement_ but instead of running the code block _once_ they jump back to the top where the _while_ is and repeat it, and keep doing so until the expression is false.

=== problem w/ while loops

sometimes they don't stop....

=== Rule for while loops
. use them sparingly
. review your while statements to make sure that eventually your testing will become false
. *when in doubt, print and test your variables* at the bottom of the whle loop to see what it is doing
