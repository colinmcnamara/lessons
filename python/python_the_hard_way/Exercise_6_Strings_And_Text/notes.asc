== Variables with sub variables
----
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r"
print joke_evaluation % hilarious
----

you can set a variable with a variable inside. This variable however doesn't have to be set. you can call this at run time. 

Example (have to clean up the strings)

port_config = 

----
int G0/1/1
	switchport mode on
	vlan %r
	description host access vlan %r
----
Then a second portion of the code would say

----
vlan = 101

print port_config % vlan
----

the output would be

----
int G0/1/1
	switchport mode on
	vlan 101
	description host access vlan 101
----
