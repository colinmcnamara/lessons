=== Learning to speak object oriented

==== Class
Tell Python to make a new thing

==== object
Two meanings, 
. the most pasic kind of thing
. any instance of some thing

==== instance
what you get when you tell python to create a class

==== def 
how you define a function inside a class

==== self
inside the functions in a class, self is a variable for the instance / object being accessed

==== inheritance
The concept that one calss can inherit traits from another class. much like you and your parents

==== composition
the concept that a class can be composed of other classes as parts, much like how a car has wheels

==== is-a
phrase to say that something inherits from another, 
- as in "a salmon is-a fish"

==== has-a 
phrase to say that something is composed of other things or has a trait
- as in "a salmon has-a mouth"


=== Random note on __init__()
does nothing except check that no argments have been passed in

=== Drills - Flash Cards

==== classX(Y)
Make a class named X that is-a Y

==== class X(object): def__init__(self,J)
Class X has-a __init__ that takes self and J parameters

==== class X(object): def M(self,J)
class x has-a function named M tha takes takes self an J parameters

==== foo = x()
set foo to an instance of Class X

==== foo.M(j)
from foo get the M function and call it with parameters self J # i didn't see self here. have to trust the writer...

==== foo.k = Q

from foo get the K attributed at set it to Q

=== Fill in your self
Fill in in english what you think these are

==== class X(Y)
make a class named X that is-a Y

==== class X(object): def__init__(self,J)
make a class named X that contanins an __init__ object with itself and J as parameters

==== class X(object): def M(self,J)
make a class named X that contains the function M that takes self and J parameters

==== foo = X()
set object foo to an instance of class X

==== foo.M(J)
from foo get function M and call it with parameters J

==== foo.K = Q

from foo get the K attribute and set it to Q - note the lack of "()"

=== more notes - .strip() method
removes _all_ whitespace at the start and the end includeing tabs, newlines and carraige returns
