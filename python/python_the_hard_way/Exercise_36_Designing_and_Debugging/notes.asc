=== designing and debugging

==== Rules for if-Statements
. Every +if-statement+ must have an +else+
. if this +else+ should never be run because it doesn't make sense 
.. then you must use a +die+ function in the +else+ that prints out an error message and dies, (just like the dead function in the bear room excersize)
. Never nest +if-statements+ more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
.. This means if you put an +if+ and an +if+  then you should be looking to move that second +if+ to another function
. Treat +if-statemnts+ like paragraphs, where each +if elif else+ grouping is like a set of sentances.
.. put blank lines before and after
. Your bolean tests should be simple. 
.. if they are complex. move the calculations to variables earlier in your function. 
.. use a good name for your variable

==== Rules for loops
. use a +while-loop+ only to loop forever.
.. that pretty much means never
. use a +for-loop+ for all other kinds of lopping. 
.. especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to do

=== Debuging tips
. Do not use a debuger
.. you get to much information
. use print statements throughout your code
. Make sure little parts of your code work
.. do not write massive stuff
.. write tests throughout 
.. code a bit, test a bit, etc etc

=== Homework - My game

What are the requirements for writing this game?

=== Required use
. Lists
. Functions
. Modules
. Find new pieces of python to do interesting stuff

==== ideas on Required ideas

. Lists
.. maybe hold each of the choices in a list. 
   have each room pull validate against an index choice
   that is +1  (which one do you want, 1, 2 or 3) 
   user puts 2, then that is (2 - 1) = 1 for the index 
. Functions
.. define a function for each room
. Modules
.. import modules such as argv
. New peices of python do interesting stuff
.. randomizer in choices? 

=== Steps
. Make a map
. Create
.. rooms
.. monsters
.. traps

. code the map
. DON'T VAPOR LOCK!!!
. Start small, get bigger and bigger

=== Map

==== Game Overview
overview of game structure (from mindmap)

===== Conversion from OPML to ASC
pandoc morning.opml --from=opml --to=asciidoc --output=morning.asc --atx-headers

=== Start

==== Room-Oh_crap_conference

You realize that you have to be at a conference tomorrow. What do you
do?

===== Call_in_sick

You pull the oldest game in the

===== Send an Employee

You decide that your employees should do some work for a change, and
send one of your guys

===== Rush to get ready

You suck it up, and pack at midnight for a 4 am flight

=== Packing for conference
Star of room

=== You_are_fired

You’re actions have resulted in you being fired.

=== You_got_promoted

your boss and the community acknowledge how awesome you are and promote
you.

=== day_off

You have many choices of what to do now that you are have free time what
do you do?

==== Go Golfing

Your boss see’s you on the golf course (he is screwing off too)

The world of double standards exists, you are fired.

====Announce you are not available but - Continue to work

Your boss and the community acknowledge how awesome you are, and you end
up getting promoted.

==== Turn off everything and hide

There is no hiding for work. Your boss, everyone on twitter is asking
where you are. Return to start

=== Delegation

====Send best guy

you decide to send the best guy on your team. This results in internal
projects slipping. you are fired.
 
==== Send worst guy

You send the worst guy on your team. The community now hates your
company, and the manufacturers think your company sucks. You are fired.

==== Send Mediocre guy

You decide to send your “good enough” guy to the conference. He holds
the proper tweet ups, and engages with all the right people since he
really has no stress of performing.

You are recognized with your amazing leadership with a promotion.

=== Just go

You decide to go, but may not have time to prep for your flight

==== Take_first_flight

You rush to take the first flight out and forget all of your equipment.
You are not able to do your video blogs. Your boss is pissed. you are
fired

==== Push_Flight_back_an_hour

This ends up costing the company and extra $500. You end up on
accountings watch list. This results in you losing your job. you are
fired.

==== Push_flight_back_a_day

You decide that day one isn’t so important. and you can push your social
media stuff to day2. What should you do with your day?
