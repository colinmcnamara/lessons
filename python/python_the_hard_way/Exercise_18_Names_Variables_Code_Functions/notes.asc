== Lesson Notes

== defining a function
def = define
indentation after : "colon" adds stuff to the function

== Function checklist

* did you start with 'def'
* does your function name only have characters and _(underscores) in the name
* did you put an open parenthesis '(' right after the function name?
* did you put your arguments after the parenthesis seperated by comma's?
* did you make each argument unique - meaning no dupicate names?
* did you put a close parenthesis and a colon '):' after the arguments?
* did you indent all the lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less
* did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting)

And when you run ("use" or "call") an function check these things:

*  did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
* did you put the ( charactuer after the name to run it?
* did you put the values you want into the parenthesis seperated by commas?
* did you end the function call with a ) character?

Repeat the following

* To 'run', 'call', or 'use' a function mean all the same thing.
