=== raw_input(...)


    raw_input([prompt]) -> string
    
    Read a string from standard input.  The trailing newline is stripped.
    If the user hits EOF (Unix: Ctl-D, Windows: Ctl-Z+Return), raise EOFError.
    On Unix, GNU readline is used if enabled.  The prompt string, if given,
    is printed without a trailing newline before reading.

=== notes on pydoc

link::http://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html[pydoc online documentation]

pydoc is basically man for python modules.

==== open
the prefered way to open a file
==== file
pretty powerful way for filemanipulation
==== os
exports all the os functions to python
	using this ensures portability between platforms. e.g. mac to win

==== sys
stuff that hooks into the interpretoer. Detailed debugging, etc.
