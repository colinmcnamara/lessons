== building help files into your module

Example  - 

help(ex25)

or 

help(ex25.break_words)

this one is the help command on the specific help function

We define that by putting """ below the def statement.
This is built into a help file

def break_words(stuff):
	"""This function will break up words for us."""
	words = stuff.split(' ')
	return words

outputs
