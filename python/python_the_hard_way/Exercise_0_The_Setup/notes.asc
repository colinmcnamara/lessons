== Lesson Notes

Set up my current dev environment w/

* Mac OSX Maverics
* Python already installed via MacPorts
* SublimeText IDE (V3)
* Populated subdirectories based on each less
* Added these directories to my Lesson's github repository 
* Mirrored the book localy to ~/code/pythonthehardway/book/
* Stripped out annoying add text
* Used Subl to change the "home" pointer across all 53 files to /book/index.html

SublimeText is very powerful. Need to set time to get to know all of it's features
