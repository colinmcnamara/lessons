== Variables with sub variables
----
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r"
print joke_evaluation % hilarious
----

you can set a variable with a variable inside. This variable however doesn't have to be set. you can call this at run time. 

Example (have to clean up the strings)

port_config = 

----
int G0/1/1
	switchport mode on
	vlan %r
	description host access vlan %r
----
Then a second portion of the code would say

----
vlan = 101

print port_config % vlan
----

the output would be

----
int G0/1/1
	switchport mode on
	vlan 101
	description host access vlan 101
----

== strings inside of strings

The four places where strings are inside of strings - 
. line 10 - y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary,do_not)
. line 13 - print x
. line 15 - print y
. line 31 - print joke_evaluation % hilarious

== is the author lying - how do i know?
Yes line 39 is technically a string w + 3 a strings

== printing w + e
this makes a longer string because it is taking the string defined in w and the adding the contents in it to e.

This math function is the content of w plus the content of e.
