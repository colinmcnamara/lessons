=== Dictionaries

=== Thoughts on my last game
*I could have used a dictionary vs comparing two lists!*

=== Quick Tip for Dictionaries - { use a different bracket }

Dictionaries use curly braces, vs straight

=== Example dictionary list
[source, python]
----
dictionaryname['room_message' : 'which door do you choose' ,'Door 1': 'room_fired', 'Door 2': 'room_promoted', 'Door 3': 'room_day_off'] 
----

print dictionaryname['room_message']
>>> which door do you choose

=== inserting new item into dictionary
You can just call out the field, and the data. 


[source, python]
----
dictionaryname['Door 4'] = 'room_delegate'
----
>>>> print dictionaryname
{'room_message' : 'which door do you choose' ,'Door 1': 'room_fired', 'Door 2': 'room_promoted', 'Door 3': 'room_day_off']}

=== Deleting from a dictionary


[source, python]
----
# delete by name 
del dictionaryname['Door 1']

# delete by index number
del dictionaryname [2]
----

>>>> print dictionaryname
{'room_message' : 'which door do you choose' , 'Door 3': 'room_day_off']}
