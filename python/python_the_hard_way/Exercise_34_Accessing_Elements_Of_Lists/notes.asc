=== Accessing Elements of Lists

=== Accessing the first element of the list

python starts at 0. Take total number and subtract 1. Example - 
a list of ten items would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Example 
[source,python]
------------------------------------------------
animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
bear = animals[0]
------------------------------------------------

==== cardinal vs ordered 
ordinal == ordered, 1st; cardinal == cards at random, 0.

==== Exercise - Lists 
----
animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']
----
. The animal at 1.
.. python
. The third (3rd) animal.
.. peacock
. The first (1st) animal.
.. bear
. The animal at 3.
.. kangaro
. The fifth (5th) animal.
.. platypus
. The animal at 2.
.. peacock
. The sixth (6th) animal.
.. does not exist - Wrong 6th place was platypus
. The animal at 4.
.. Whale

Time for a test on lists
Here is the list of animals

The  index num ? is bear 
The  index num ? is python 
The  index num ? is peacock 
The  index num ? is kangaroo 
The  index num ? is whale 
The  index num ? is platypus 

What is the index number for whale in the list we just printed
> 4
You Rock! The answer whale was index number 4 
Press Enter to continue...

Using a for loop to enumerate
the animal in number 1 place in the list is index 0 bear 
the animal in number 2 place in the list is index 1 python 
the animal in number 3 place in the list is index 2 peacock 
the animal in number 4 place in the list is index 3 kangaroo 
the animal in number 5 place in the list is index 4 whale 
the animal in number 6 place in the list is index 5 platypus 

Using a function with a for loop to enumerate Animals
The animal at index num 0 is bear 
The animal at index num 1 is python 
The animal at index num 2 is peacock 
The animal at index num 3 is kangaroo 
The animal at index num 4 is whale 
The animal at index num 5 is platypus 

Using a function with a for loop to enumerate Years
The year at index num 0 is 2000 
The year at index num 1 is 2001 
The year at index num 2 is 2002 
The year at index num 3 is 2003 
The year at index num 4 is 2004 
The year at index num 5 is 2005 
The year at index num 6 is 2006 
The year at index num 7 is 2007 
The year at index num 8 is 2008 
The year at index num 9 is 2009 
The year at index num 10 is 2010

=== Using python to check answers
maybe use a raw_input

enumerate list
ask what is item 1 (raw_input)

if then statement 
if var that is set by raw_input == index then success
if var set by raw_input != zero then loop to raw function (def)

could do if > index say you are to high
if you are < say you are to low

=== raw_input takes info as strings!!!
have to prepend int(raw_input("> "))
to have it look for the integer

=== Code
Exersize -- note. I want eventually do this via include file
