=== branches and functions

Apparently my mind is going to get bent

=== pydoc
need to figure out how to interact with pydoc 

=== kind off stuck of the final gold room 
integer statements

line 8-10 looked for numbers 0 and 1. if if found those it change 

[source,python]
----
raw_input 
# to 
int(raw_input("> "))
----

easy way to validate if this is an integer is to define a function that tests 

[source,python]
----
def RepresentesInt(s):
	try:
		int(s)
		return(True) 
	except ValueError:
		return False
----

Then you can call it later within a function

[source,python]
----
	if RepresentesInt(next) == True:
		how_much = int(next)
	else:
		dead("Man, learn to type a number")
----
