=== File operations 
=== seek

seek(	offset[, whence])
Set the file's current position, like stdio's fseek(). The whence argument is optional and defaults to 0 (absolute file positioning); other values are 1 (seek relative to the current position) and 2 (seek relative to the file's end). There is no return value. Note that if the file is opened for appending (mode 'a' or 'a+'), any seek() operations will be undone at the next write. If the file is only opened for writing in append mode (mode 'a'), this method is essentially a no-op, but it remains useful for files opened in append mode with reading enabled (mode 'a+'). If the file is opened in text mode (without 'b'), only offsets returned by tell() are legal. Use of other offsets causes undefined behavio

=== file

The file object attributes:
Once a file is opened and you have one file object, you can get various information related to that file.

Here is a list of all attributes related to file object:

Attribute	Description
file.closed	Returns true if file is closed, false otherwise.
file.mode	Returns access mode with which file was opened.
file.name	Returns name of the file.
file.softspace	Returns false if space explicitly required with print, true otherwise.

=== shorthand notation +=

adds another value to the variables value and assigns the new value to the variable
----
x = 2
x = x += 1
print x
3
----

=== other shorthand math 

-=, *=, /= does similar for subtraction, multiplication and division.
