== Raw_Input
What does raw_input do?

It presents a prompt to the user (the optional arg of raw_input([arg])), gets input from the user and returns the data input by the user in a string. See the docs for raw_input().

Example:

----
name = raw_input("What is your name? ")
print "Hello, %s." % name
----

The difference with input() is that it tries to interpret the input given by the user; it is usually best to avoid input() and to stick with raw_input() and custom parsing/conversion code.

== input vs raw_input
input is interpretted, raw_input is passed cleanly through the system

== test using input
the tick in 6' 4" resulted in the following

----
cmcnamara@colin-mbp  (master) $ python ex11.py 
How old are you? 34
how tall are you?
6' 4"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex11.py", line 4, in <module>
    height = input()
  File "<string>", line 1
    6' 4"
        ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
----

== %r vs %s ( solution to drill 4)
changing from %r to %s took the '' from around the printed output. raw vs string.
